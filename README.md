### What is Business Intelligence?

Business intelligence (BI) is the use of computing technologies for the identification, discovery and analysis of business data - like sales revenue, products, costs and incomes.

BI technologies provide current, historical and predictive views of internally structured data for products and departments by establishing more effective decision-making and strategic operational insights through functions like online analytical processing (OLAP), reporting, predictive analytics, data/text mining, benchmarking and Business Performance Management (BPM). These technologies and functions are often referred to as information management.
